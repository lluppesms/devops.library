# Lyle's DevSecOps Library

This repository contains a collection of DevSecOps tools and templates that I have created and used in my own projects.  I hope that you find them useful as well.

There are four main categories of resources in this repository:

- The **azd** folder contains files that are needed to support the "azd" command line tool in your projects. For more information, see:

  - [azd Deploy Usage](azd/readme.md)
  - [azd Project Compatibility](azd/AzdDeploy.md)

- The **azdo** folder contains sample YML template for Azure DevOps pipelines.  See:

  - [AzDO Pipelines](azdo/readme.md)

- The **github** folder contains sample YML template for GitHub Action workflows.  See:

  - [GitHub Actions](github/readme.md)

- The **Bicep** folder contains three types of Bicep files:

  - [Bicep Resource Examples](Bicep/Resource-Examples/readme.md)
  - [Main.Bicep Examples](Bicep/main.bicep-Examples/readme.md)
  - [Using a Bicep Container Registry](Bicep/Bicep-Container-Registry/readme.md)
